## Create a new project (DNX)

**DotVVM** is going to support the DNX and new .NET Core however we are not ready for the complete switch yet.
We have working alpha version - if you can't wait, you can check out development version at [`dotnetUnified` branch](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm/tree/dotnetUnified). Also have a look at [release notes draft](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm/releases) to see what is new. You can also help us with development or send us feedback, how it works for you.

Our Visual Studio Extension sometimes breaks on .NET Core project, don't worry please. We will publish .NET Core compatible version soon, it mostly works in our dev versions.
